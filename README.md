# Team4


Team: Ioannou Elias &amp; Ivanov Alexandar &amp; Rahimzadeh Abtin

Meeting 1:

We sat down at the lab and decided what we would do first. First and foremost
we decided that role setting would be most appropriate and so we decided that Elias would do the javascript, Alex would do the all the styling of the app and landing page and Abtin would do the testing page with all its requirements.

Meeting 2:

The first steps were taken as we started working on the project. Elias made an app that shows the list of all the available
treasure hunts and the user can now enter a username and get a session back. Alex designed the index page adding some text and doing the css for the early stages of it.

Meeting 3:

Elias got stuck on the /question part of the code but he manage to overcome it after some help and learning new things from the lecture and the labs.
Alex continued designing alongside Elias. Some small issues came up for Alex which were solved the same day as we talked on discord and coded.

Meeting 4:

A functioning app was developed which had some issues. The app was able to allow the user to play a full game and take them to the leaderboard. Elias noticed a few bugs as he was developing it
and they were fixed soon after with some code adjustments. Alex designed the whole app page to look simplistic and effective so the user
does not get overwhelmed.

Meeting 5:

The app was done but without cookies so Elias started building the functionality with cookies and added some error handling so
the user knows what they did wrong if they come out with an error. Alex added some fancy leaderboard loading functionality  and the program came to a wrap.

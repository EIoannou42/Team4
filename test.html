    <h1>Testing</h1>

    <hr>
        <br><h2 class="TestingTitles">Heuristics</h2>
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">1. Visibility of system status:</h2>
        <br>We have a system visibility and its a number based one, it's as your current/total number of pages.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">2. Match between system and the real world:</h2>
        <br>There was not a need for this one since our system is game and not a web that interacts with the players.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">3. User Control and Freedom:</h2>
        <br>We have one and it's only in the landing page, because the game is a fast paced one and you have to answer fast and correctly.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">4. Consistency and Standards:</h2>
        <br>The games consistency and standards are on point, for instance, we place the positive answers on the right and the negative ones on the left.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">5. Error Prevention:</h2>
        <br>There is some sort of error prevention its not throughout the game but in places that is crucial.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">6. Recognition rather than recall:</h2>
        <br>There was not a need for this one since the user has to find the answer, else what is the point of the game then.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">7. Flexibility and Efficiency of use:</h2>
        <br>Same as here there was not a need for this one as well.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">8. Aesthetic and minimalist design:</h2>
        <br>The game is not that big for such functionalities.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:</h2>
        <br>There are not that many possibilities to help the player for the errors since the app is not that complicated.
        <br><h2 class = "Heuristics">10. Help and Documentation:</h2>
        <br>The app provides guidance when it's needed.

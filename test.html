    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <input type="button" onclick="window.location.href='index.html';"  value="Back to Home Page" class = "BackHome">
    <p>There is a start quiz button which starts the game in the main page. Moreover, in the landing page there are 3 options to choose from and they are the different sessions the user can choose, also below that there is a start button which starts the game and a home button which takes the user to the home page. In the actual game there are 5 types of buttons. Submit one, that the user types their answer in text and presses the submit to register their answer, there is also a skip button that skips the question and the players loses points, a true and false ones which is for either agreeing or disagreeing and lastly multiple choice one that has 4 answers and the player chooses the one that is correct in their opinion.

        <br><h2>Heuristic 1: Visibility of system status</h2>
        <br>We have a system visibility and its a number based one, it's as your current/total number of pages.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 2: Match between system and the real world</h2>
        <br>There was not a need for this one since our system is game and not a web that interacts with the players.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 3:  User control and freedom</h2>
        <br>We have one and it's only in the landing page, because the game is a fast paced one and you have to answer fast and correctly.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 4:  Consistency and standards</h2>
        <br>The games consistency and standards are on point, for instance, we place the positive answers on the right and the negative ones on the left.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 5: Error prevention</h2>
        <br>There is some sort of error prevention its not throughout the game but in places that is crucial.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 6: Recognition rather than recall</h2>
        <br>There was not a need for this one since the user has to find the answer, else what is the point of the game then.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>
        <br>Same as here there was not a need for this one as well.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
        <br>The game is not that big for such functionalities.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 9:  Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
        <br>There are not that many possibilities to help the player for the errors since the app is not that complicated.
        <br><h2>Heuristic 10: Help and documentation</h2>
        <br>The app provides guidance when it's needed.
